       "## Streets (Centerline)\n",
       "\n",
       "This street centerline lines feature class represents current right of way in the City of Los Angeles. It shows the official street names and is related to the official street name data. The Mapping and Land Records Division of the Bureau of Engineering, Department of Public Works provides the most current geographic information of the public right of way. The right of way information is available on NavigateLA, a website hosted by the Bureau of Engineering, Department of Public Works.<br /> <br />Street Centerline layer was created in geographical information systems (GIS) software to display Dedicated street centerlines. The street centerline layer is a feature class in the LACityCenterlineData.gdb Geodatabase dataset. The layer consists of spatial data as a line feature class and attribute data for the features. City of LA District Offices use Street Centerline layer to determine dedication and street improvement requirements. Engineering street standards are followed to dedicate the street for development. The Bureau of Street Services tracks the location of existing streets, who need to maintain that road. Additional information was added to Street Centerline layer. Address range attributes were added make layer useful for geocoding. Section ID values from Bureau of Street Services were added to make layer useful for pavement management. Department of City Planning added street designation attributes taken from Community Plan maps. The street centerline relates to the Official Street Name table named EASIS, Engineering Automated Street Inventory System, which contains data describing the limits of the street segment. A street centerline segment should only be added to the Street Centerline layer if documentation exists, such as a Deed or a Plan approved by the City Council. Paper streets are street lines shown on a recorded plan but have not yet come into existence on the ground. These street centerline segments are in the Street Centerline layer because there is documentation such as a Deed or a Plan for the construction of that street. Previously, some street line features were added although documentation did not exist. Currently, a Deed, Tract, or a Plan must exist in order to add street line features. Many street line features were edited by viewing the Thomas Bros Map's Transportation layer, TRNL_037 coverage, back when the street centerline coverage was created. When TBM and BOE street centerline layers were compared visually, TBM's layer contained many valid streets that BOE layer did not contain. In addition to TBM streets, Planning Department requested adding street line segments they use for reference. When those line features were added to the spatial data, a DEDRQ field value of &quot;Proposed&quot; was added in the attribute data for that record. Further, the street centerline layer features are split where the lines intersect. The intersection point is created and maintained in the Intersection layer. The intersection attributes are used in the Intersection search function on NavigateLA on BOE's web mapping application NavigateLA. The City of Los Angeles Municipal code states, all public right-of-ways (roads, alleys, etc) are streets, thus all of them have intersections. Note that there are named alleys in the BOE Street Centerline layer. Since the line features for named alleys are stored in the Street Centerline layer, there are no line features for named alleys in those areas that are geographically coincident in the Alley layer. For a named alley , the corresponding record contains the street designation field value of ST_DESIG = 20, and there is a name stored in the STNAME and STSFX fields.<br /><br />List of Fields:<br />SHAPE: Feature geometry.<br />OBJECTID: Internal feature number.<br />DEDRQ: Dedication requirement. Values:<br />     •  1 - Dedication not required<br />     •  3 - Dedication may be required<br />     •  0 - Dedication requirement unknown<br />     •  2 - Dedication required<br />STNAME_A: Street name Alias.<br />ST_SUBTYPE: Street subtype.<br />SV_STATUS: Status of street in service, whether the street is an accessible roadway.

The value relates to the intersection layer attribute table, to the CL_NODE_ID field. The values are assigned automatically and consecutively by the ArcGIS software first to the street centerline data layer and then the intersections data layer, during the creation of new intersection points. Each intersection identification number is a unique value.<br />SECT_ID: Section ID used by the Bureau of Street Services. Values:<br />     •  none - No Section ID value<br />     •  private - Private street<br />     •  closed - Street is closed from service<br />     •  temp - Temporary<br />     •  propose - Proposed construction of a street<br />     •  walk - Street line is a walk or walkway<br />     •  known as - <br />     •  numeric value - A 7 digit numeric value for street resurfacing<br />     •  outside - Street line segment is outside the City of Los Angeles boundary<br />     •  pierce - Street segment type<br />     •  alley - Named alley<br />STSFX_A: Street suffix Alias.<br />SFXDIR: Street direction suffix Values:<br />     •  N - North<br />     •  E - East<br />     •  W - West<br />     •  S - South<br />CRTN_DT: Creation date of the polygon feature.<br />STNAME: Street name.<br />ZIP_L: Zip code left.<br />STSFX: Street suffix.

Values:<br />     •  ___B___, ___A___, ___-5A___ - Any of these alpha-numeric combinations are used, whereas the underlined spaces are the numbers.<br />STNUM: Street identification number. This field relates to the Official Street Name table named EASIS, to the corresponding STR_ID field.<br />ASSETID: User-defined feature autonumber.<br />TEMP: This attribute is no longer used. This attribute was used to enter 'R' for reference arc line segments that were added to the spatial data, in coverage format. Reference lines were temporary and not part of the final data layer. After editing the permanent line segments, the user would delete temporary lines given by this attribute.<br />LST_MODF_DT: Last modification date of the polygon feature.<br />REMARKS: This attribute is a combination of remarks about the street centerline. Values include a general remark, the Council File number, which refers the street status, or whether a private street is a private driveway. The Council File number can be researched on the City Clerk's website <a href=\"http://cityclerk.lacity.org/lacityclerkconnect/\" target=\"_blank\">http://cityclerk.lacity.org/lacityclerkconnect/</a><br />INT_ID_FROM: Street intersection identification number at the line segment's start node. The value relates to the intersection layer attribute table, to the CL_NODE_ID field. The values are assigned automatically and consecutively by the ArcGIS software first to the street centerline data layer and then the intersections data layer, during the creation of new intersection points. Each intersection identification number is a unique value.<br />ADRF: From address range, right side."

Because the assessment funds collected in a given district cannot legally be spent outside of that BID, the City creates a trust fund for each BID, with funds periodically released to support operations.

       "## Wye Connectors\n",
       "\n",
       "This connector wye feature class represents current wastewater information in the City of Los Angeles. The connector wye is the location of a chimney. The Mapping and Land Records Division of the Bureau of Engineering, Department of Public Works provides the most rigorous geographic information of the sanitary sewer system using a geometric network model, to ensure that its sewers reflect current ground conditions. The sanitary sewer system, pump plants, wyes, maintenance holes, and other structures represent the sewer infrastructure in the City of Los Angeles. Wye and sewer information is available on NavigateLA, a website hosted by the Bureau of Engineering, Department of Public Works.For a complete list of attribute values, please refer to (TBA Wastewater data dictionary). <br /> <br />Wastewater Connector Wye points layer was created in geographical information systems (GIS) software to display the location of wastewater connection points at the wye pipe lines. The connector wye layer is a feature class in the LACityWastewaterData.gdb Geodatabase dataset. The layer consists of spatial data as a point feature class and attribute data for the features. The connector wye points are entered when the wye pipe lines are edited based on wastewater sewer maps and BOE standard plans, and information about the points is entered into attributes. The connector wye is a structure connected to the wye pipe line. Reference the WYE_SUBTYPE field for the type of structure. The WYE_ID field value is the unique ID. The WYE_ID field relates to the Sewer Permit tables. The wastewater connector wye points are inherited from sewer spatial data originally created by the City's Wastewater program. The database was known as SIMMS, Sewer Inventory and Maintenance Management System. Wye pipe information should only be added to the Wastewater wye pipes layer if documentation exists, such as a wastewater map approved by the City Engineer. Sewers plans and specifications proposed under private development are reviewed and approved by Bureau of Engineering. The Department of Public Works, Bureau of Engineering's, Brown Book (current as of 2010) outlines standard specifications for public works construction. For more information on sewer materials and structures, look at the Bureau of Engineering Manual, Part F, Sewer Design, F 400 Sewer Materials and Structures section, and a copy can be viewed at <a href=\"http://eng.lacity.org/techdocs/sewer-ma/f400.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://eng.lacity.org/techdocs/sewer-ma/f400.pdf</a>.<br /><br />List of Fields:<br />REHAB: This attribute indicates if the pipe has been rehabilitated.<br />BOTTOM: When a chimney is present, this is the depth at the bottom of the chimney.<br />TOP_: When a chimney is present, this is the depth at the top of the chimney.<br />PL_DEPTH: This value is the depth of the service connection at the property line.<br />TYPE: This is the old wye status and is no longer referenced.<br />SHAPE: Feature geometry.<br />LAST_UPDATE: Date of last update of the point feature.<br />USER_ID: The name of the user carrying out the edits of the wye data.<br />SPECIAL_STRUCT: This describes the special structure.

       "\n",
       "This parcels polygons feature class represents current city parcels within the City of Los Angeles. It shares topology with the Landbase parcel lines feature class. The Mapping and Land Records Division of the Bureau of Engineering, Department of Public Works provides the most current geographic information of the public right of way, ownership and land record information. The legal boundaries are determined on the ground by license surveyors in the State of California, and by recorded documents from the Los Angeles County Recorder's office and the City Clerk's office of the City of Los Angeles. Parcel and ownership information are available on NavigateLA, a website hosted by the Bureau of Engineering, Department of Public Works.Associated information about the landbase parcels is entered into attributes. Principal attributes include:PIN and PIND: represents the unique auto-generated parcel identifier and key to related features and tables. This field is related to the LA_LEGAL, LA_APN and LA_HSE_NBR tables. PIN contains spaces and PIND replaces those spaces with a dash (-).LA_LEGAL - Table attributes containing legal description. Principal attributes include the following:TRACT: The subdivision tract number as recorded by the County of Los AngelesMAP_REF: Identifies the subdivision map book reference as recorded by the County of Los Angeles.LOT: The subdivision lot number as recorded by the County of Los Angeles.ENG_DIST: The four engineering Districts (W=Westla, C=Central, V= Valley and H=Harbor).CNCL_DIST: Council Districts 1-15 of the City of Los Angeles. OUTLA means parcel is outside the City.LA_APN- Table attributes containing County of Los Angeles Assessors information. Principal attributes include the following:BPP: The Book, Page and Parcel from the Los Angeles County Assessors office. SITUS*: Address for the property.LA_HSE_NBR - Table attributes containing housenumber information. Principal attributes include the following:HSE_ID: Unique id of each housenumber record.HSE_NBR: housenumber numerical valueSTR_*: Official housenumber addressFor a complete list of attribute values, please refer to Landbase_parcel_polygons_data_dictionary.<br /><br />Landbase parcels polygons data layer was created in geographical information systems (GIS) software to display the location of the right of way. The parcels polygons layer delineates the right of way from Landbase parcels lots. The parcels polygons layer is a feature class in the LACityLandbaseData.gdb Geodatabase dataset. The layer consists of spatial data as a polygon feature class and attribute data for the features. The area inside a polygon feature is a parcel lot. The area outside of the parcel polygon feature is the right of way. Several polygon features are adjacent, sharing one line between two polygons. For each parcel, there is a unique identifier in the PIND and PIN fields. The only difference is PIND has a dash and PIN does not. The types of edits include new subdivisions and lot cuts. Associated legal information about the landbase parcels lots is entered into attributes. The landbase parcels layer is vital to other City of LA Departments, by supporting property and land record operations and identifying legal information for City of Los Angeles. The landbase parcels polygons are inherited from a database originally created by the City's Survey and Mapping Division. Parcel information should only be added to the Landbase Parcels layer if documentation exists, such as a Deed or a Plan approved by the City Council. When seeking the definitive description of real property, consult the recorded Deed or Plan.<br /><br />List of Fields:<br />ID: A unique numeric identifier of the polygon. The ID value is the last part of the PIN field value.<br />ASSETID: User-defined feature autonumber.<br />MAPSHEET: The alpha-numeric mapsheet number, which refers to a valid B-map or A-map number on the Cadastral grid index map. Values:<br />     •  ___B___, ___A___, ___-5A___ - Any of these alpha-numeric combinations are used, whereas the underlined spaces are the numbers. An A-map is the smallest grid in the index map and is used when there is a large amount of spatial information in the map display. There are more parcel lines and annotation than can fit in the B-map, and thus, an A-map is used. There are 4 A-maps in a B-map. In areas where parcel lines and annotation can fit comfortably in an index map, a B-map is used. The B-maps are at a scale of 100 feet, and A-maps are at a scale of 50 feet.<br />OBJECTID: Internal feature number.<br />BPP<br />MAP_REF<br />TRACT<br />BLOCK<br />MOD<br />LOT<br />ARB<br />CNCL_DIST: LA City Council District. Values:<br />     •  (numbers 1-15) - Current City Council Member for that District can be found on the mapping website http://navigatela.lacity.org/navigatela, click Council Districts layer name, under Boundaries layer group.<br />SHAPE: Feature geometry.<br />BOOK<br />PAGE<br />PARCEL<br />PIND: The value is a combination of MAPSHEET and ID fields, creating a unique value for each parcel. The D in the field name PIND, means &quot;dash&quot;, and there is a dash between the MAPSHEET and ID field values. This is a key attribute of the LANDBASE data layer. This field is related to the APN and HSE_NBR tables.<br />ENG_DIST: LA City Engineering District. The boundaries are displayed in the Engineering Districts index map. Values:<br />     •  H - Harbor Engineering District.<br />     •  C - Central Engineering District.<br />     •  V - Valley Engineering District.<br />     •  W - West LA Engineering District.<br />PIN: The value is a combination of MAPSHEET and ID fields, creating a unique value for each parcel. There are spaces between the MAPSHEET and ID field values. This is a key attribute of the LANDBASE data layer. This field is related to the APN and HSE_NBR tables."

       "This physical structures points feature class represents current wastewater information in the City of Los Angeles. The maintenance hole structure is used to provide access to the sewer from the surface. The Mapping and Land Records Division of the Bureau of Engineering, Department of Public Works provides the most rigorous geographic information of the sanitary sewer system using a geometric network model, to ensure that its sewers reflect current ground conditions. The sanitary sewer system, pump plants, wyes, maintenance holes, and other structures represent the sewer infrastructure in the City of Los Angeles. Wye and sewer information is available on NavigateLA, a website hosted by the Bureau of Engineering, Department of Public Works.Associated information about the wastewater Physical_structure is entered into attributes. Principal attributes include:JUNCTION_SUBTYPE: junction subtype is the principal field that describes various types of points as either Diversion Structure, Drop or Drop Trap, Flush, Junction Chamber, Junction Structure, Maintenance, Offset, Other Structure, Siphon, Special Shallow, Special Structure, Terminal, Transition, Trap, Valve Vault, Weir. For a complete list of attribute values, please refer to (TBA Wastewater data dictionary).  <br /><br />Wastewater Physical Structures points layer was created in geographical information systems (GIS) software to display the location of wastewater structures. The structures points layer is a feature class in the LACityWastewaterData.gdb Geodatabase dataset. The layer consists of spatial data as a points feature class and attribute data for the features. The points are entered manually based on wastewater sewer maps and BOE standard plans, and information about the points is entered into attributes. The physical structures points data layer differs from non-structures points data layer, such that physical structures points are maintenance holes. Reference the JUNCTION_SUBTYPE and MH_TYPE field for the type of structure. The STRUCTURE_ID field value is the unique ID. The wastewater structures points are inherited from a sewer spatial database originally created by the City's Wastewater program. The database was known as SIMMS, Sewer Inventory and Maintenance Management System. Structures information should only be added to the Wastewater Structures layer if documentation exists, such as a wastewater map approved by the City Engineer. Sewers plans and specifications proposed under private development are reviewed and approved by Bureau of Engineering. The Department of Public Works, Bureau of Engineering's, Brown Book (current as of 2010) outlines standard specifications for public works construction.
