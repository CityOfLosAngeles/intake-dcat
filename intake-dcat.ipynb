The Mapping and Land Records Division of the Bureau of Engineering, Department of Public Works provides the most rigorous geographic information of the sanitary sewer system using a geometric network model, to ensure that its sewers reflect current ground conditions. The sanitary sewer system, pump plants, wyes, maintenance holes, and other structures represent the sewer infrastructure in the City of Los Angeles. Wye and sewer information is available on NavigateLA, a website hosted by the Bureau of Engineering, Department of Public Works.Associated information about the wastewater Wye is entered into attributes. Principal attributes include:WYE_SUBTYPE: wye subtype is the principal field that describes various types of points as either Chimney, Chimney Riser, Offset Chimney Riser, Siphon, Special Case, Spur, Tap, Tee, Unclassified, Vertical Tee, Vertical Tee Riser, Wye, Wye Drawn as a Tap.For a complete list of attribute values, please refer to (TBA Wastewater data dictionary).<br /><br />Wastewater Wye pipes lines layer was created in geographical information systems (GIS) software to display the location of wastewater wye pipes. The wyes lines layer is a feature class in the LACityWastewaterData.gdb Geodatabase dataset. The layer consists of spatial data as a line feature class and attribute data for the features. The lines are entered manually based on wastewater sewer maps and BOE standard plans, and information about the lines is entered into attributes. The wye pipes lines features are sewer pipe connections for buildings. The features in the Wastewater connector wye points layer is a related structure connected with the wye pipe line. The WYE_ID field value is the unique ID. The WYE_ID field relates to the Sewer Permit tables. The annotation wye features are displayed on maps alongside features from the Wastewater Sewer Wye pipes lines layer. The wastewater wye pipes lines are inherited from a sewer spatial database originally created by the City's Wastewater program. The database was known as SIMMS, Sewer Inventory and Maintenance Management System. Wye pipe information should only be added to the Wastewater wye pipes layer if documentation exists, such as a wastewater map approved by the City Engineer. Sewers plans and specifications proposed under private development are reviewed and approved by by Bureau of Engineering.

       "                    This street centerline lines feature class represents current right of way in the City of Los Angeles. It shows the official street names and is related to the official street name data. The Mapping and Land Records Division of the Bureau of Engineering, Department of Public Works provides the most current geographic information of the public right of way. The right of way information is available on NavigateLA, a website hosted by the Bureau of Engineering, Department of Public Works.<br /> <br />Street Centerline layer was created in geographical information systems (GIS) software to display Dedicated street centerlines. The street centerline layer is a feature class in the LACityCenterlineData.gdb Geodatabase dataset. The layer consists of spatial data as a line feature class and attribute data for the features. City of LA District Offices use Street Centerline layer to determine dedication and street improvement requirements. Engineering street standards are followed to dedicate the street for development. The Bureau of Street Services tracks the location of existing streets, who need to maintain that road. Additional information was added to Street Centerline layer. Address range attributes were added make layer useful for geocoding. Section ID values from Bureau of Street Services were added to make layer useful for pavement management. Department of City Planning added street designation attributes taken from Community Plan maps. The street centerline relates to the Official Street Name table named EASIS, Engineering Automated Street Inventory System, which contains data describing the limits of the street segment. A street centerline segment should only be added to the Street Centerline layer if documentation exists, such as a Deed or a Plan approved by the City Council. Paper streets are street lines shown on a recorded plan but have not yet come into existence on the ground. These street centerline segments are in the Street Centerline layer because there is documentation such as a Deed or a Plan for the construction of that street. Previously, some street line features were added although documentation did not exist. Currently, a Deed, Tract, or a Plan must exist in order to add street line features. Many street line features were edited by viewing the Thomas Bros Map's Transportation layer, TRNL_037 coverage, back when the street centerline coverage was created. When TBM and BOE street centerline layers were compared visually, TBM's layer contained many valid streets that BOE layer did not contain. In addition to TBM streets, Planning Department requested adding street line segments they use for reference. When those line features were added to the spatial data, a DEDRQ field value of &quot;Proposed&quot; was added in the attribute data for that record. Further, the street centerline layer features are split where the lines intersect. The intersection point is created and maintained in the Intersection layer. The intersection attributes are used in the Intersection search function on NavigateLA on BOE's web mapping application NavigateLA. The City of Los Angeles Municipal code states, all public right-of-ways (roads, alleys, etc) are streets, thus all of them have intersections. Note that there are named alleys in the BOE Street Centerline layer. Since the line features for named alleys are stored in the Street Centerline layer, there are no line features for named alleys in those areas that are geographically coincident in the Alley layer. For a named alley , the corresponding record contains the street designation field value of ST_DESIG = 20, and there is a name stored in the STNAME and STSFX fields.<br /><br />List of Fields:<br />SHAPE: Feature geometry.<br />OBJECTID: Internal feature number.<br />DEDRQ: Dedication requirement.

The Mapping and Land Records Division of the Bureau of Engineering, Department of Public Works provides the most rigorous geographic information of the sanitary sewer system using a geometric network model, to ensure that its sewers reflect current ground conditions. The sanitary sewer system, pump plants, wyes, maintenance holes, and other structures represent the sewer infrastructure in the City of Los Angeles. Wye and sewer information is available on NavigateLA, a website hosted by the Bureau of Engineering, Department of Public Works.For a complete list of attribute values, please refer to (TBA Wastewater data dictionary). <br /> <br />Wastewater Connector Wye points layer was created in geographical information systems (GIS) software to display the location of wastewater connection points at the wye pipe lines. The connector wye layer is a feature class in the LACityWastewaterData.gdb Geodatabase dataset. The layer consists of spatial data as a point feature class and attribute data for the features. The connector wye points are entered when the wye pipe lines are edited based on wastewater sewer maps and BOE standard plans, and information about the points is entered into attributes. The connector wye is a structure connected to the wye pipe line. Reference the WYE_SUBTYPE field for the type of structure. The WYE_ID field value is the unique ID. The WYE_ID field relates to the Sewer Permit tables. The wastewater connector wye points are inherited from sewer spatial data originally created by the City's Wastewater program. The database was known as SIMMS, Sewer Inventory and Maintenance Management System. Wye pipe information should only be added to the Wastewater wye pipes layer if documentation exists, such as a wastewater map approved by the City Engineer. Sewers plans and specifications proposed under private development are reviewed and approved by Bureau of Engineering. The Department of Public Works, Bureau of Engineering's, Brown Book (current as of 2010) outlines standard specifications for public works construction.

       "                    This parcels polygons feature class represents current city parcels within the City of Los Angeles. It shares topology with the Landbase parcel lines feature class. The Mapping and Land Records Division of the Bureau of Engineering, Department of Public Works provides the most current geographic information of the public right of way, ownership and land record information. The legal boundaries are determined on the ground by license surveyors in the State of California, and by recorded documents from the Los Angeles County Recorder's office and the City Clerk's office of the City of Los Angeles. Parcel and ownership information are available on NavigateLA, a website hosted by the Bureau of Engineering, Department of Public Works.Associated information about the landbase parcels is entered into attributes. Principal attributes include:PIN and PIND: represents the unique auto-generated parcel identifier and key to related features and tables. This field is related to the LA_LEGAL, LA_APN and LA_HSE_NBR tables. PIN contains spaces and PIND replaces those spaces with a dash (-).LA_LEGAL - Table attributes containing legal description. Principal attributes include the following:TRACT: The subdivision tract number as recorded by the County of Los AngelesMAP_REF: Identifies the subdivision map book reference as recorded by the County of Los Angeles.LOT: The subdivision lot number as recorded by the County of Los Angeles.ENG_DIST: The four engineering Districts (W=Westla, C=Central, V= Valley and H=Harbor).CNCL_DIST: Council Districts 1-15 of the City of Los Angeles. OUTLA means parcel is outside the City.LA_APN- Table attributes containing County of Los Angeles Assessors information. Principal attributes include the following:BPP: The Book, Page and Parcel from the Los Angeles County Assessors office. SITUS*: Address for the property.LA_HSE_NBR - Table attributes containing housenumber information. Principal attributes include the following:HSE_ID: Unique id of each housenumber record.HSE_NBR: housenumber numerical valueSTR_*: Official housenumber addressFor a complete list of attribute values, please refer to Landbase_parcel_polygons_data_dictionary.<br /><br />Landbase parcels polygons data layer was created in geographical information systems (GIS) software to display the location of the right of way. The parcels polygons layer delineates the right of way from Landbase parcels lots. The parcels polygons layer is a feature class in the LACityLandbaseData.gdb Geodatabase dataset. The layer consists of spatial data as a polygon feature class and attribute data for the features. The area inside a polygon feature is a parcel lot. The area outside of the parcel polygon feature is the right of way. Several polygon features are adjacent, sharing one line between two polygons. For each parcel, there is a unique identifier in the PIND and PIN fields. The only difference is PIND has a dash and PIN does not. The types of edits include new subdivisions and lot cuts. Associated legal information about the landbase parcels lots is entered into attributes. The landbase parcels layer is vital to other City of LA Departments, by supporting property and land record operations and identifying legal information for City of Los Angeles. The landbase parcels polygons are inherited from a database originally created by the City's Survey and Mapping Division. Parcel information should only be added to the Landbase Parcels layer if documentation exists, such as a Deed or a Plan approved by the City Council. When seeking the definitive description of real property, consult the recorded Deed or Plan.<br /><br />List of Fields:<br />ID: A unique numeric identifier of the polygon. The ID value is the last part of the PIN field value.<br />ASSETID: User-defined feature autonumber.<br />MAPSHEET: The alpha-numeric mapsheet number, which refers to a valid B-map or A-map number on the Cadastral grid index map. Values:<br />     •  ___B___, ___A___, ___-5A___ - Any of these alpha-numeric combinations are used, whereas the underlined spaces are the numbers. An A-map is the smallest grid in the index map and is used when there is a large amount of spatial information in the map display. There are more parcel lines and annotation than can fit in the B-map, and thus, an A-map is used. There are 4 A-maps in a B-map. In areas where parcel lines and annotation can fit comfortably in an index map, a B-map is used. The B-maps are at a scale of 100 feet, and A-maps are at a scale of 50 feet.<br />OBJECTID: Internal feature number.<br />BPP<br />MAP_REF<br />TRACT<br />BLOCK<br />MOD<br />LOT<br />ARB<br />CNCL_DIST: LA City Council District.

       "                    This physical structures points feature class represents current wastewater information in the City of Los Angeles. The maintenance hole structure is used to provide access to the sewer from the surface. The Mapping and Land Records Division of the Bureau of Engineering, Department of Public Works provides the most rigorous geographic information of the sanitary sewer system using a geometric network model, to ensure that its sewers reflect current ground conditions. The sanitary sewer system, pump plants, wyes, maintenance holes, and other structures represent the sewer infrastructure in the City of Los Angeles. Wye and sewer information is available on NavigateLA, a website hosted by the Bureau of Engineering, Department of Public Works.Associated information about the wastewater Physical_structure is entered into attributes. Principal attributes include:JUNCTION_SUBTYPE: junction subtype is the principal field that describes various types of points as either Diversion Structure, Drop or Drop Trap, Flush, Junction Chamber, Junction Structure, Maintenance, Offset, Other Structure, Siphon, Special Shallow, Special Structure, Terminal, Transition, Trap, Valve Vault, Weir. For a complete list of attribute values, please refer to (TBA Wastewater data dictionary).  <br /><br />Wastewater Physical Structures points layer was created in geographical information systems (GIS) software to display the location of wastewater structures. The structures points layer is a feature class in the LACityWastewaterData.gdb Geodatabase dataset. The layer consists of spatial data as a points feature class and attribute data for the features. The points are entered manually based on wastewater sewer maps and BOE standard plans, and information about the points is entered into attributes. The physical structures points data layer differs from non-structures points data layer, such that physical structures points are maintenance holes. Reference the JUNCTION_SUBTYPE and MH_TYPE field for the type of structure. The STRUCTURE_ID field value is the unique ID. The wastewater structures points are inherited from a sewer spatial database originally created by the City's Wastewater program. The database was known as SIMMS, Sewer Inventory and Maintenance Management System. Structures information should only be added to the Wastewater Structures layer if documentation exists, such as a wastewater map approved by the City Engineer. Sewers plans and specifications proposed under private development are reviewed and approved by Bureau of Engineering. The Department of Public Works, Bureau of Engineering's, Brown Book (current as of 2010) outlines standard specifications for public works construction.

The conduits and inlets represent the storm drain infrastructure in the City of Los Angeles. Storm drain information is available on NavigateLA, a website hosted by the Bureau of Engineering, Department of Public Works.Associated information about the wastewater Pipe is entered into attributes. Principal attributes include:PIPE_SUBTYPE: pipe subtype is the principal field that describes various types of lines as either Airline, Force Main, Gravity, Siphon, or Special Lateral.For a complete list of attribute values, please refer to (TBA Wastewater data dictionary). <br /><br />Wastewater pipe lines layer was created in geographical information systems (GIS) software to display the location of sewer pipes. The pipe lines layer is a feature class in the LACityWastewaterData.gdb Geodatabase dataset. The layer consists of spatial data as a line feature class and attribute data for the features. The lines are entered manually based on wastewater sewer maps and BOE standard plans, and information about the lines is entered into attributes. The pipe lines are the main sewers constructed within the public right-of-way in the City of Los Angeles. The ends of line segments, of the pipe lines data, are coincident with the wastewater connectivity nodes, cleanout nodes, non-structures, and physical structures points data. Refer to those layers for more information. The wastewater pipe lines are inherited from a sewer spatial database originally created by the City's Wastewater program. The database was known as SIMMS, Sewer Inventory and Maintenance Management System. For the historical information of the wastewater pipe lines layer, refer to the metadata nested under the sections Data Quality Information, Lineage, Process Step section. Pipe information should only be added to the Wastewater Pipes layer if documentation exists, such as a wastewater map approved by the City Engineer.
